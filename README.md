# Spacecraft-Simulations-Using-Python
1. Developed four different spacecraft simulations using Python, inspired by the Kerbal Space Program game.
2. Demonstrated the difference between projectile motion on a flat Earth surface and in Newtonian gravity through detailed simulations.
3. Simulated a two-stage rocket around a planet called Kerbin, representing Earth in the game.
4. Showcased the effects of aerodynamics on the projectile of the two-stage rocket, illustrating significant changes in altitude and speed.
5. Utilized advanced Python libraries for numerical computations and data visualization to enhance the accuracy and presentation of the simulations.
